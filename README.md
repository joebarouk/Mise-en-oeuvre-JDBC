# Mise-en-oeuvre-JDBC
1- I created a database on MS Access and then created a simple table with 3 columns and 3 rows.

2- I used UCanAccess as the JDBC Driver to make the connection between my Java app and the Access database I created.

3- After downloading the zip file of UCanAccess, I unzipped the folder then added the jar files to the ClassPath of the project via Intellij IDEA.

4- I wrote the code that makes the connection with the database.
